The relevant codes for paper 'Deep-learning-assisted communication capacity enhancement by non-orthogonal state recognition of structured light'


This package contains the open source codes for a published paper named 'Deep-learning-assisted communication capacity enhancement by non-orthogonal state recognition of structured light.

For dataset generation, I only upload the simulation codes (matlab) that one may need to create many kinds of structured fields and I give up uploading experimental datasets cus
they are literally too many. But still, I think those codes can help someone who are interested in spatial structured light under different coordinate systems.
